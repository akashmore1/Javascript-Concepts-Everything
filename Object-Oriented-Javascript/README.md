# Object Oriented Javascript

OOP is programming paradigm.

## Principles of Oops:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

### Abstraction:

1. Ignoring the details that don't matter allowing us to get an overview perspective of the things we are implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really matter in implementation.

### Encapsulation:

1. Encapsulation means keeping methods and properties inside class private, so they are not accessible outside class.
2. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface(API).

### Inheritance:

1. Child class inherits properties of parent class.

### Polymorphism:

1. A child class can override a method it inherited from a parent class.

## OOP in JS

Object is instance of a class.
In js, we create objects using constructor function.
In ES6 we use classes. But in background we are using constructor functions only, ES6 classes are only 'syntactical sugar'
ES6 classes do not behave like classes in classical OOP.
We can also create object using Object.create() => This is the easiest and most straight forward way of linking an onject to prototype object.
